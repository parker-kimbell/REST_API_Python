1) Can the same user have multiple GUIDs?
2) Is it okay if I change the POST on an update to PUT? I feel that this would be more semantically correct as this operation is idempotent.
3) Is there an upper limit on how long GUIDs can be available for? Is it okay if this is also the default limit of 30 days? Is there a lower limit?
4) Do you have a preferred limit on GUID cache size?
