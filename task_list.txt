VALIDATIONS

1) Check that timestamps passed in are in UNIX time
2) If no timestamp is given, generate one that is 30 days out from the time of GUID creation. We should only need to do this on a POST.
3) Validate that GUIDs passed in on generation are 32 hexadecimal character strings with all letters uppercase.
4) Ignore GUIDs passed in on an update. Log this assumption in post-mortem/README
5) Create a GUID on a POST if one is not specified. It must be a random 32
6) Validate that request objects are valid JSON
